## how to get started
This page goes over in more detail the most common things people ask about or may wish to adjust after an install. i.e. special build related stuff that normal official openwrt does not have.


## are you sure?
- first time OpenWrt users recommended to use stable official (21.02)...
- suppose it wouldn't hurt to whack this on for a quick spin...
- switch back to an OfficialBuild as soon as you become confused... ;)

## but I need to get stuff

[What hardware do I need](https://github.com/wulfy23/rpi4/blob/master/HARDWARE.md)



## flashing

[see: forum guide [forum.openwrt.org/t/rpi4-community-build](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/rpi4-community-build/69998)]

but for linux users(there are some windows instructions in the link above);
```
zcat /path/to/factory.img.gz | dd of=/dev/sdMMCDEVLETTER; sync
```

- 'fac'(factory) = factory>(g)unzip>sdcard
- 'sys'(sysupgrade) = sysupgrade


NOTE: Flashing can take extra time... due to 1G i.e.;

- Seriously... go hang the washing or something
```
                         samsungevo-internalsd: 2-3 mins
                    generic-sandisk-internalsd:   7 mins
```     
- (green-act-led on means flashing)
- (usb key with led helps to see board general state i.e. is it really rebooting now)
- (20210216~2.7.71+ unitializing blink status)
	- slow throbbing blink during firstboot setup solid when done(-ish)
	- connect optional custom front case led

### *non-community-upgrade-only (good luck - experimental/no longer supported, pro's only)*
- !!! sysupgrade -p  !!! switch to take new partition sizes !!!
- sysupgrade on non-community backup + ensure rc.local has exit 0
- note: the two options above, aka 'upgrading-to-this-build' are less advised/tested... it's preferred if you start fresh factory->sdcard ( a config backup etc/config/* restore is ok )



## WooHoo, I gots-webui -> Now What?

- Enable(and start) the additional services you use
- Setup your custom ini parameters (ENABLEDSERVICES!!!)
- Be mindfull of special custom data files and directories go into /etc/sysupgrade.conf
- Once you think everything is running great or before/after making major changes use the backup feature in the updatecheck bar to download a backup of your settings (or if capable once in a while make a dd image of your sdcard)












# QUIRKS

## wifi
- technically wifi is not supported by this build and a stand alone auxillary AP is required for production env
- use a third party access point ($65AUD/37US) and avoid stress, time wastage, limited performance...
- however, build wise please ensure 'wpad' is enabled and started...
- further issues: (unless with auto-setup scripts) should be addressed on the general OpenWrt forum... after you do some searching and reading first...


## misc
- some autosetup functionality is dependant on eth1-usb

- disabled services... desired services might be disabled
out of the box in order not to bog down people who don't use them.
enable what you use, and provide feedback if something is bloaty /
or needed by default. see forum for more info.

- extroot-overlay[unsupported]... (see lower)

- ~wifi ap/ac issue (reportedx2: mine works fine)

        -see TODO

         -partuuid(usb-support) means backup restore requires you to check
         or move and replace your current cmdline.txt(distfeeds/customfeeds also)
         post restore...
         UPDATE: if you use the topbar backup it will exclude cmdline.txt so these
                 should restore fine... backups made via traditional methods need
                 cmdline PARTUUID updated or changed to root=/dev/mmcblk0p2
                 prior to reboot on manual restore (or creation)


        -/root in its entirety should not be part of your sysupgrade.conf
         ( community > community ) individual files and directories will
         be ok... efforts are underway to overcome this...


        -using sysupgrade -n has never been tested you'd assume that
         it would leave you with something similar to a factory install
         although i suspect there would be a glitch or two... lucklily...
         zapping a new factory to an sdcard is an equivalent workaround


        -extroot/overlay will/may cause issues for some script logix...
         only use this if you are prepared to report logs / are an
         intermediate user or above... as these make upgrading difficult
         anyway, its recommended you just point service config to a
         usb-mount where applicable this saves the hassle of pkgdata
         on upgrade and is handled (reasonable) transparently
         Can fix extroot-overlay underlying issues if someone capable
         reports the problems, would likely effect, packagerestore
         upgrade, backup etc logix


        -luci_statistics will fail to start if collectd-mod-x is not installed
         and is enabled in /etc/config/luci_statistics > module, as firstboot
         scripts setup these modules... and sysupgrade auto-removes packages
         you have removed... i'd suggest just leaving all modules installed for
         now and possibly cp statistics config file pre/post upgrade if you
         want to disable some default modules...


- rc.local style scripts should be placed in /etc/custom/startup ...
	-see examples there and make sure to add to sysupgrade.conf avoid
	- editing rc.local but if there is a real need ask on the support page and we'll work something out...


- sdcard writes... unlike a stock image, this build makes use of sdcard storage to keep traffic / statistical data across reboots. if you are averse to any disk writes, you can disable this option. given the cost of sdcards, the infrequency of reboots, and the utility of persisent data ... this is generally a functional win.
	- if you wish to store your data somewhere other than the default... like an attached usb device... you should also disable this...


- full_packages: procps-ng-{ps,df,top?} will likely create issues with some of the custom scripts within the build, avoid installing them or discuss on the forum. tar, gzip
	-UPDATE: some of these tools have now been added with a -full suffix... i.e. top-full ps-full for command line usage








## Legacy Notes
- add /root/wrt.ini to your /etc/sysupgrade.conf (done automatically)
- create /etc/packagesremove.txt and add to sysupgrade.conf(adding likely now automatic)
